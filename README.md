# Atmega328_Millis

Timer example implementing millis() and delay() in AtmelStudio 7.
See Atmega328P_Millis/main.c for the code.

There are gazillions of examples like this out there, but mostly just hints or pieces, not full examples with comments. 
Took me hours to fill in the gaps - hope this helps others (or my older me...)

It is all in here (http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATmega48A-PA-88A-PA-168A-PA-328-P-DS-DS40002061A.pdf), 
but 662 pages is a long read, maybe start at section 15 if you need to know more...
